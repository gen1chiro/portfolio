            <h1 className='font-semibold w-5/6'>I am a third-year Computer Science student and aspiring Full Stack Developer. </h1>
            <h1 className='w-5/6'>In my spare time, I enjoy learning about web development and the latest technologies to keep up with this competitive industry. Currently, I am learning Next.js and planning to gradually transition to learning the backend after having spent significant time focusing on the frontend.</h1>
            <h1 className='w-5/6'>My learning journey actually only started in my second year of university. Up until that point, I didn't even know what software engineers did. As with any young adult, I was nervous and anxious, realizing I was almost halfway through university and still unsure of my direction, yet I knew I wanted to be a developer.</h1>
            <h1 className='w-5/6'>My journey began with FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course, where I learned step by step. After a few weeks, I moved on to JavaScript, then TypeScript, then React, and so on. I like to follow a study-then-apply strategy when learning something new, and using this approach, I’ve created a number of projects I’m quite proud of.</h1>
            <h1 className='w-5/6'>At this point, I’ve been learning web development for about a year now. In hindsight, I think I could have learned a lot more if I had been more consistent, but I am still immensely proud of how far I’ve come.</h1>
            <h1 className='w-5/6'>If you took the time to read all that thank you.</h1>
